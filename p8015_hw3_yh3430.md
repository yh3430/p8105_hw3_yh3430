## Problem 1

Description of the dataset, load instacart data

The ‘instacart’ dataset is the order history of over 3 million online
orders collected from more than 200,000 instacart users. The dataset
includes order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id,
eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day,
days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle,
department variables.

The dataset contains 1,384,617 observations of 131,209 unique users.
Each column represent a variable that indicate specific information. THe
produc name variable shows the name of the product that were ordered on
Instacart. the department variable show the name of department where the
products were located. The aisle variable represents the name of the
aisle, which includes 134 types of items. Among all the items listed in
aisle, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and packaged vegetables fruits
are the top three items ordered through Instacart. Figure in part 2
shows the online order items, which were order more than 10,000 times.
The fresh vegetables and fresh fruits were order much more often than
all the other items.They are almost the 5 times of the average order
time of all the other items.

``` r
data("instacart")
```

part 1(a), number of aisels - 134 items

``` r
instacart_df =
  force(instacart) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n())
```

part 1(b), top 3 aisles ordered are fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and
packaged vegetables fruits.The fresh vegetables and fresh fruits were
ordered more 150,000 times.

``` r
instacart_most_aisle =
  force(instacart) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  mutate(
    top_order_aisles = min_rank(n_obs)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) %>% 
  filter(top_order_aisles > 131)
```

part 2 plot of number of items ordered in each aisles

The fresh vegetables and fresh fruits, which were order more than
150,000 time, were order much more often than all the other items. They
are almost the 5 times of the average order time of all the other items.
The packaged vegetables fruits were ordered about 80,000 times. All the
other products were order about 20,000 time.

``` r
instacart_df %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  filter(as.numeric(n_obs) > 10000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n_obs, y = aisle)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Instacart online items order more than 10,000",
    x = "number of orders",
    y = "item names",
    caption = "Data from The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017"
  )

part 3 table of top three product in baking ingredients”, “dog food
care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits” listed in aisles.

The packaged vegetables fruits were ordered about ten time more often
than other two types of items. Among packaged vegetables fruits, the
organic baby spinach was ordered twice more often the other two types of
items. the products in dog food care aisle were order about 30 times,
which was 10% of the order time of baking ingredients. People are in
great need of packaged vegetable fruits than other two aisles.

``` r
pop_product = 
  instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  select(product_name, aisle) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, aisle) %>%

## Problem 2

part 1 load, clean and manipulate the BRFSS data

factor(response, levels = c(“Poor”, “Fair”, “Good”, “Very good”,
“Excellent”))

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010") 
```

``` r
health_data_df =
  force(brfss_smart2010) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  filter(response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")) %>% 
  group_by(response) %>% 
  mutate(
    response = factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"))
  )
```

part 2(a) states observation in 2002 and 2010

In 2002, 36 states were observed at 7 or more locations. And in 2010, 45
states were observed 7 or more locations. In addition, the figure
illustrate us that the states were observed more time in 2010 than in
2002. And FL was observed more than 200 location in 2010.

``` r
location_df =
  health_data_df %>% 
  filter(year %in% c("2002", "2010")) %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_obs > 6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = n_obs, y = locationabbr)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ year)
```

part 2(b) plot of average value within a state over time

The overall trend of the average data value of Excellent response within
the states is slightly decreased from 2002 to 2010. Some states
includes, FL, IL, LA, WY, CA, CT, experience extreme average data value
of Excellent response change between 2004 and 2008. Some states
includes, ME, MI, MS, MT, NC has relatively stable average data of
Excellent response trends. Among these state, WY has the lowest average
data value of Excellent response.

``` r
state_plot_df =
  health_data_df %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  select(year, locationabbr, locationdesc, data_value) %>% 
  group_by(year, locationabbr) %>% 
  summarize(mean_state_value = mean(data_value)) %>%

part 2(c) two panel plot from 2006 and 2010 at NY state

The observation of response in NY states includes more Good, Very good,
and Excellent than Poor and Fair. And we have observed little difference
of the overall response between 2006 and 2010. Among counties in NY
state, we observed more Very good and Excellent response in Westchester
county in 2010. And we observed more Poor to Good response in Bronx
county in 2010. However, 2006 has different observations of response. We
oberved more Poor and Fair response in Queens county, and more Good to
Excellent response in Nassau county.

``` r
NY_data_df =
  health_data_df %>% 
  filter(locationabbr == "NY") %>% 
  filter(year %in% c("2006", "2010")) %>%

## Problem 3

part 1 load and manipulate data

After manipulation the data, we have variables include week, day id,
day, weekday_end, and activity.\*. The dataset recorded the activity
counts of five week (35 days), 25 weekdays, 10 weekend days, and 1,440
minutes of each day.

``` r
accel_data =
  read_csv("accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_end = recode(day, "Monday" = "Weekday", "Tuesday" = "Weekday", "Wednesday" = "Weekday", "Thursday" = "Weekday", "Friday" = "Weekday", "Saturday" = "Weekend", "Sunday" = "Weekend")
  ) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, weekday_end, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(
    day = ordered(day, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
  )
```

    ## Rows: 35 Columns: 1443

    ## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr    (1): day
    ## dbl (1442): week, day_id, activity.1, activity.2, activity.3, activity.4, ac...

    ## 
    ## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

part 2 total activity over the day

The figure of day_id over activity_day did not show any special overall
trend of daily activity. However, activity distributed closely around
4e+05 from day 10 to day 20. The activities in Monday increased from day
1 to day 17, and decreased to 4e+05 at day 23. The activity in Tuesday
and Wednesday are relatively stable around 4e+05. The activities in
Thursday remained stable around 4e+05 before day 26 and increased to
5.5e+05 until the end. The activities in Friday dropped from 5e+05 at
day 1 to 1.5e+05 at day 22 and increased back to 5.5e+05 at the last
day. The activities in Saturday and Sunday dropped significantly from
day 1 to day 35.

``` r
accel_day =
  accel_data %>% 
  mutate(
    activity_day = rowSums(select(., starts_with("activity")))
  ) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, weekday_end, activity_day) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_id, y = activity_day, color = day)) +
  geom_point() +
    viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Counties",
    discrete = TRUE

part 3

Majority of the activity counts of the patient below 1500. After week 1,
patient have more activities. And the patient tends to have more
activities in Friday. The activities on Monday increased from week 1 to
3, and decreased a small amount in week 4 and 5. The activities on
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday increase from week 1 to week 2, and remain
stable until the end. The activity of Saturday increase from week 1 to
week1, and decreased to a small amount from week 3 to week 5. The
activities on Sunday decreased from week 1 to week 5.
